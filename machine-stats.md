# Machine Stats

## Let's get started

This guide will show you how to install and use Machine Stats for Unix-like
Systems.

Click the **Start** button to move to the next step.

## Project selection

You first need to select a project to host the resources created in this tutorial.

## What is Machine Stats?

Before we jump in, let's briefly go over what Machine Stats can do.

Machine Stats is an application which provides a simple and effective way to
gather machine statistics (RAM, Storage, CPU) from a server environment.

Machine Stats for Unix-like Systems leverages
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to gather facts in a cross-platform way.

Continue on to the next step to install Machine Stats.

## Installation

Install Machine Stats:

```bash
python3 -m pip install machine-stats
```

Make sure that Machine Stats was installed successfully:

```bash
machine-stats --help
```

Next, you’ll create some VM instances.

## Creating VM instances

<walkthrough-open-cloud-shell-button></walkthrough-open-cloud-shell-button>

Let's use Google Cloud Deployment Manager to create a pool of VMs:

```bash
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create instance-pool --config deployment/instance-pool.yaml
```

Next, you’ll review the list of VM instances.

## Hosts

First of all let's have a look at the list of the running VMs:

```bash
gcloud compute instances list
```

Next, you'll make it possible to connect to those VMs via SSH.

## SSH connection

To make it possible for Machine Stats to connect to those hosts you need to
generate and provide SSH keys:

```bash
./generate-ssh-key
```

Under the hood it creates all the necessary SSH key files and updates all the VM
instances metadata.

Next, you'll create an inventory file.

## Inventory file

Let's write the list of IPs alongside with SSH key locations to the
`hosts` file:

```bash
./generate-hosts
```

Next, you'll run Machine Stats with the generated inventory file.

## The first run

Now, when you have the `hosts` file ready, let's try to get some information
about those hosts using Machine Stats:

```bash
machine_stats hosts
```

You should see the JSON output with your hosts details.

Next, you'll install Tidal Tools to load Machine Stats data to Tidal Migrations.

## Tidal Tools

Let's install Tidal Tools:

```bash
curl https://get.tidal.sh/unix | bash 
```

Make sure that Tidal Tools installed correctly:

```bash
tidal version
```

Login to your account:

```bash
tidal login
```

Next, you'll sync your servers.

## Syncing your servers

To sync your servers run the following command:

```bash
machine_stats hosts | tidal sync servers
```

Next, you'll learn how to sync your servers periodically.

## Sync servers periodically

Run the shell script as following:

```bash
./repeat-machine-stats
```

<walkthrough-footnote>
The better way to run Machine Stats and Tidal Tools periodically is to use
`cron` or systemd services and timers.

Open your **Tidal Migrations Platform** and search for one of the hosts on the
**Assess/Servers** page.

## Congratulations
